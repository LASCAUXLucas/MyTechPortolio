I am thrilled to introduce myself as a finance market enthusiast and a budding data analyst. My name is Lucas Lascaux, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Finance Market Studies. While my passion lies in the exciting world of finance, I have developed a deep interest in the realm of data analysis, where I leverage coding to extract valuable insights from data. 

Throughout my academic journey in finance, I have come to appreciate the power of data in making informed decisions in the financial markets. As I explored different aspects of finance, I realized the pivotal role data analysis plays in generating valuable business intelligence.

In this presentation, I would like to share with you some of the code snippets that demonstrate my journey into the world of data analysis.
